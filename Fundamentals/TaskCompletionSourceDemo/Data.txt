Look at this from the perspective of the original event handler above. The event handler has absolutely no idea whether its tasks are going to run on one thread or multiple threads. All it knows is that it has requested 3 potentially asynchronous tasks to be completed. The underlying implementation will determine whether additional threads come in to play or not. And whether you have multiple threads determines whether you run in parallel or not.
